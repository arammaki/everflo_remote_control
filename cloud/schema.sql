-- One reading per frame per engine version.
--
-- The point of the compound key: a frame analysed by the engine that was
-- current when it arrived keeps that reading forever, and re-analysing it
-- later with a recalibrated engine adds a row rather than overwriting one.
-- That makes "what did it say then" and "what would it say now" both
-- answerable, which is the whole reason the table exists.
--
-- `engine` is the content hash of balldetector.js, computed at build time by
-- build_webui.mjs. A hash rather than a version string because it cannot drift
-- from the code the way a constant someone has to remember to bump can.

-- Firmware builds the device may install over the air, from anywhere.
--
-- `armed_at` is the whole safety model. A build sitting here is inert: the
-- device is told about it only once a human has armed it, with a second
-- deliberate command. That keeps the rule the project had before OTA existed
-- — an update happens because a person pushed one, never because the device
-- went looking. Publishing and arming are separate on purpose; a single
-- "deploy" verb would make the dangerous thing the easy thing.
--
-- The ingest handler clears armed_at as soon as a reading arrives reporting
-- that version, so "armed" means "waiting to land" and never lingers as a
-- standing invitation.
--
-- md5 is what the device verifies the download against, and is the header
-- name HTTPUpdate looks for (x-MD5). Not a signature: it catches a corrupted
-- transfer, not a malicious one. Anyone who can write this table or the R2
-- object owns the device.
