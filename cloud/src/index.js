   EverFlo ingest Worker.

   The device POSTs a JPEG with metadata in the query string. This Worker
   stores the image in R2, writes a row to D1, and returns 204.

   Deliberately NOT behind Cloudflare Access: Access challenges every
   request, and an ESP32 cannot complete an interactive login. The device
   authenticates with a bearer token instead. The admin UI is a separate
   Worker and that one can use Access.

   The detection engine does not run here. Running it would need a second
   JPEG decoder whose pixels may differ from the browser's, and the
   calibration and quality gates are tuned on browser-decoded pixels with
   a test suite that is not in this repo. Until that path is validated
   against the labelled set, `flow` stays NULL and the image is the record.
