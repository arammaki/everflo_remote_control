# Test images

Two sets, and they are checked in opposite directions. Both run through the
same harness so the two directions cannot drift apart:

```sh
node tools/validate_engine.mjs test/sweep-2026-08-22
node tools/validate_engine.mjs test/negative-old-poses --expect-rejected
```

## `sweep-2026-08-22/` — the calibration in force

The 23 labelled frames the current engine is built from: `REF_PNG`, the bands,
`BASE_TILT` and `CAL` all come from these. Taken 2026-08-22 20:06–20:14 under
the WS2812 at level 50 in a dark kitchen — the lighting the unit actually runs
in. The 21 frames carrying a number must read within 0.2 L/min of it.

They are here because the repo already contained everything *derived* from
them and nothing to derive it from. A recalibration is judged by comparing the
new sweep against this one, and `tools/validate_engine.mjs` had no data to run
against without them.

Two frames carry a state rather than a value. `0_min` is the ball against its
resting stop: it must produce a reading, and does so as "Under 0,3" — there is
no true value to compare against. `over_max` was taken deliberately past the
end of the printed scale and must come back as `Max` rather than as a number.
`5.7_max` despite its name is an ordinary labelled value, the top mark, and is
compared numerically: it reads 5.76 at y=154.4, four pixels below the Max
boundary at y=150.

## `negative-old-poses/` — 78 frames that must be refused

The sweeps from 2026-08-13, 08-15 and 08-16, from three camera poses that no
longer exist. Their labels were true when they were taken and are worthless
now, which is exactly what makes them useful: a frame from the wrong camera
pose must be **refused**, not read, and these are real frames rather than
synthetic ones. Measured 2026-09-05: all 78 refused. Registration runs
0.224–0.785 and two of them clear the 0.75 gate, but shift and spread catch
those.

**What this set does and does not prove.** Evaluate each gate on its own and
registration refuses 76 of the 78 and is the sole reason on 8; ambiguity
refuses 49 but is never the only gate refusing, and contrast never fires. So
the set constrains registration, and a change that loosened ambiguity would
pass it while being entirely untested. Do not read a green run here as
permission to touch that gate — `judge()` returns on the first gate that
fires, so its printed reason will happily say "ambiguity" for a frame the
shift gate was also refusing.

Do NOT run the plain harness over this directory — without `--expect-rejected`
it reports 78 failures, which is the correct answer to the wrong question.

This covers one case of the negative suite described in CLAUDE.md. Garbage
frames, occlusions, large shifts and wrong rotation are still uncovered, as is
the tolerance suite that says a 15 px shift, blur or a thin occluder must
still read about right. Those are constructible from the sweep above.
