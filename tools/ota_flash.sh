#  Flash the sketch to the unit over the LAN (ArduinoOTA).

#      tools/ota_flash.sh                 # build + show what would be sent
#      tools/ota_flash.sh -y              # ... and actually send it
#      tools/ota_flash.sh 192.168.1.21    # an explicit address, default syrgas.local
#
#  Two commands rather than one with a prompt: the first is inert and tells
#  you the version, size and target, the second replaces the firmware.
#
#  You must be on the same wifi as the device. This replaces the
#  firmware driving a motor bolted to an oxygen concentrator, so it
#  builds first, checks what it is about to send, and says out loud what
#  is going where before it sends it.
#
#  Why a script and not the one-liner it replaces: the one-liner was long
#  enough to wrap, and a wrapped paste is what put the OTA password in
#  the terminal in plain text on 2026-08-17 — it had to be rotated. Here
#  the password is read from secrets.h into espota's argument and is
#  never printed. (It is still visible in `ps` for the duration of the
#  transfer; espota.py has no way to take it from a file or the
#  environment. On a personal laptop that is the residual risk.)
#
#  It ALWAYS rebuilds. The stale-binary trap is real: on 2026-08-22 the
#  binary sitting in build/ was five days old and still said 1.9.7, so
#  flashing it would have been a no-op that looked like a failed change.
#
#  There is no rollback. If a build boots badly, recovery is USB — which
#  is why this is the path for a first boot: you are standing next to it.

# without one simply stays silent. So the AAAA query waits out its full
# timeout before the resolver falls back to the address it already had.
